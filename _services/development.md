All apps are compiled as **universal binaries** to run natively on both Apple **silicon** and **Intel-based** Mac computers. I develop primarily for **macOS** and some of my server applications are also meant to be deployed on **Unix** systems.

I have plans for future mobile apps to be run on the **iPad** and have experimented quite successfully with porting them to native Mac apps through Mac **Catalyst** technology.
