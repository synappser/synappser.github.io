Apps are currently only signed with an Apple Development Certificate (without notarization). You might therefore get an *Application is damaged* or *Unidentified Developer* popup stating they *can't be opened*. In which case follow [Apple's instructions for opening an app from an unidentified developer](https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/open-a-mac-app-from-an-unidentified-developer-mh40616/mac){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"} (basically, **control-click the app icon, choose Open from the shortcut menu, then click Open again**) to open either the application or its dmg for the first time.

On macOS Ventura, an additional step might be needed where you go to System Settings > Privacy & Security and scroll down to Security (this is on MacOS 13.1). You'll find a note that the application was not opened because it is from an "Unknown Developer". Click "Open Anyway" then continue ignoring warnings and the program will work.
