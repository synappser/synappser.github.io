- Adds a View settings pane (please consider it still experimental)
- It currently allows to Show/Hide Sidebar, Toolbar, Path Bar, and Status Bar on newly opened windows
- The Sidebar width can also be set precisely in pixels
- An option to "Automatically remove .DS_Store files", deletes them as soon as they get created in the root folder of the Home and Applications directories, yielding more control to FinderFix
- A "Relaunch Finder" push button allows to act on "recalcitrant" windows
- An enhancement request for narrower Finder windows [[#7](https://github.com/synappser/FinderFix/issues/7){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"}] has been implemented to set the minimum window dimensions with each of the Sidebar, Toolbar, Tab Bar, Path Bar, and Status Bar hidden to 316 w x 300 h (291 by cheating with the menu bar)
- Fixes the system error beep sound emitted when trying to move the caret with arrow keys inside the text fields
