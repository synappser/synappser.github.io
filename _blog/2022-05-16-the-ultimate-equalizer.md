description: In praise of anonymity
---

I cherish anonymity and I laud the Internet for allowing me to enforce it. Take this as a manifesto of my core ethos.

I want my users to judge me by the quality of my software not by me belonging to a specific country.

Most developers I know are broad-minded and tolerant. Their (often liberal) opinions do not necessarily align with those of their country's government.

I want to be spared the collective boycott (punishment) some developers are getting just because of a foreign sounding name or if by pure coincidence the country they belong to suddenly "turns bad". I think you'd easily admit that it's all a very relative concept.

**Disclaimer:** Any similarity with actual or current political events is purely coincidental.
