**Simply a Trash Can on your Desktop**

With my laptop's small display, I have Dock-hiding always turned on â€“ anyway the trash icon doesn't show the file count and a quick Command-Option-D brings it back. Like many of you, I got used to the Trash Can on the Desktop with DragThing that I later replaced with Bin-it until the latter was also discontinued. Lately I tried, in vain, iCollections' Trash pane (some of you may have even know the original Mac OS 9 trash can!).

However, all of these were not real-time, sometimes taking several seconds to refresh their content. If I remember correctly, Bin-it was even limited to the local Trash (i.e. the ~/.Trash folder). What's more with my bad eyesight, I needed a big red badge for the total count (the typical Apple NSColor.red for badges), in order not to have to stare for long seconds at the icon to read its count. I am quite obsessive about not deleting something by mistake, and assume others are like me, that's the reason for the big red badge for visibility.

What's remarkable about **TrashEye** is its refresh speed in real-time. It also has practically zero impact on both CPU and memory.

Stay tuned. You'll soon be able to try it!
